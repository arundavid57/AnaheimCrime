# AnaheimCrime

This little project concerns with performing exploratory analysis on criminal arrest log. I decided to do it while staying at my aunt's house in Anaheim, CA. The data obtained from Anaheim Open Data website(http://anaheim.opendata.junar.com/home) and consists of police's arrest log from May,05 to Jun,04, 2016. The intend is to do some simple investigation of crimes around my neighborhood and play with Jupyter's markdown functionality.
